This is a web app for checking the weather.

I used the following tools in order to build it:

- [React](https://facebook.github.io/react) as the front-end framework

- [Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/) for styling

- [Open Weather](http://openweathermap.org) for weather data

- [Heroku](http://heroku.com) for deployment
